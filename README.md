## Overview :bulb:

I built a website, from scratch.. So it's week 2 of coding Bootcamp and I'm feeling pretty confident, things are clicking and I'm starting to understand the material. Also, I felt like I had a stellar performance on the homework; the refractored code looked good, managing my Github felt like a lost skill that was re-surfacing and GitHub commands started to feel natural, even after a few beer's I could probably still run Git Bash. As I'm writing this I can only laugh at myself for being over-confident after only 4-days of Bootcamp. I don't know.. I felt like to knew a lot but I'm still at the begining of this journey. 

Anyway's week 2 was a wake up call! The next project, "the one I just finished!" was to create a responsive website from scratch. At first I felt like it was going to be challenging but not too bad.. I soon found out after reviewing the sample images of the site we're building this was way outside of my comfort zone. I have some previous knowledge of HTML/CSS but not quite at the level to create a website in a few days. 

As of now, I've completed the assignment and it was defintely a learning experience. It was pure persistence and help from students to complete this website. 

Here's what the site looked like yesterday after spending a good 5+ hours on it.

## Conslusion :boom:

Looking at the Old Site vs the New Site, I'm shocked that I was able to pull this off. Honestly, going in I felt a bit uncomfortable, and didn't imagine I would get it to visually look close to the examples. Persistance and reaching out for help, was key. I wasted so much time trying to figure things out on my own, which isn't a bad thing but it always good to get someone else's perspective. Moving forward I'm feeling good but humble, this assignment was "eye-opener" for me to focus more and apply myself.
